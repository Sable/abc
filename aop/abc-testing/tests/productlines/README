This directory includes a modified version of the code which can be
found at:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/rlopez/Publications.html

under the heading for 
  "Using AspectJ to Implement Product-Lines: A Case Study"

-----------------------------------------------------------------

What was changed:

 1. made the code work for ajc 1.1 (previously written for ajc 1.0)

      - had to include private constructors in many classes, so that
          intertype declarations could be used to put the ordinary
          public constructors there.   If the orginal classes have
          the default constructor (public), then an aspect class cannot put
          one there.   This additional check was added in ajc 1.1.

        Here are those changes:
          FinishTimeWorkSpace.java:{  private FinishTimeWorkSpace() { super(); }
          Graph.java:{ private Graph() { super(); }
          Neighbor.java:{ private Neighbor() { super(); }
          NumberWorkSpace.java:{  private NumberWorkSpace() { super(); }
          RegionWorkSpace.java:{ private RegionWorkSpace() { super(); }
          Vertex.java:   private Vertex() {super();}
          WorkSpaceTranspose.java:{ private WorkSpaceTranspose() { super(); }

     - in Benchmark.java,  replaced
              static long Graph.last=0, Graph.current=0, Graph.accum=0;

           with
             static long Graph.last=0; 
             static long Graph.current=0; 
             static long Graph.accum=0;
           (is this a bug in ajc, it would not accept the first one?)

  2. added MyLog.java DoPrinting.java and NoPrinting.java
         - changed many occurences of System.out.println to MyLog.println
                               and    System.out.print   to MyLog.print

         - DoPrinting just defines MyLog.println and MyLog.print to call
              System.out.println and System.out.print

         - NoPrinting just defines MyLog.println and MyLog.print to do
              nothing

  3. added ProgTime.java so that longer timing runs could be made

  4. edited Example1.lst and Example2.lst to include new files

  5. added Time1.lst, Time2.lst and Time3.lst for timing runs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program can be compiled using ajc -argfile with the following:

  Example1.lst   -   testing example 1
  Example2.lst   -   testing example 2

  Time1.lst  - timing example 1
  Time2.lst  - timing example 2
  Time3.lst  - timing example 3

----------------
If compiled for the first two cases, then the program is run using 
a command like:

     java GPL.Prog ./BENCH/MSTExample.bench v0

and by default the file DoPrinting.java is included which will cause
a lot of output.

----------------
If compiled for the last three cases, then the program is configured
to do larger examples suitable for timing and should be run with
something like:

    java GPL.ProgTime 1000 10000 400 2 13,

where the arguments are:  num_vertices
                          num_edges
                          max_weight
                          num_repetitions
                          seed


and by default the file NoPrinting.java is included instead of 
DoPrinting.java,  so only the minimal amount of output is given.
