How to use the code:

   1.  Decide on the files you wish to instrument.

   2.  For the class definition containing the main entry point,
       <main>.java,  create a file <main>.properties which gives
       a mapping of classnames in your application to their static
       coupling metric.   If you do not define such a file,  all static
       values will be assumed to be zero.   If you do not include all
       classes in your .properties list,  then any missing class will
       be given a static value of 0.


   3.  Compile using ajc 1.1 or later,  using

    ajc <yourjavafiles> DCM/*.java DCM/handleMetrics/*.java

        -or-

    ajc <yourjavafiles> DCM/*.java DCM/handleMetrics/*.java DCM/handleGC/*.java

    For the first case,  the metrics will not account for objects dying due
    to garbage collection.   For the second case objects will die when
    the finalize method is called on them due to GC,  and the metrics will
    only be computed using live objects.

   4.  run using java <main>, and a summary report will be written at the
         exit of main giving the dynamic coupling metric for each class,
         and the total.

   5.  What you might want to change,
         DCM/Pointcuts.java   defines which constructors and methods
           to include in the computation of DCM.    The pointcuts,
           as given will include all constructors and calls in the
           code provided in <yourjavafiles> as in the <ajc> command. 
           This should be the usual case.

         DCM/handleMetrics/Metrics.java
            you can redefine the value for dumpinterval,
                 -1 :  only dump results at end of run (DEFAULT)
                  1 :  dump at each time step (plus some debugging info)
                k>1 :  dump each k time steps (no debugging info)

         DCM/handleGC/AllocFree.java
            you can redefine the value for gcinterval,
                 -1 :  only explicitly call gc when the VM triggers it (DEFAULT)
                k>1 :  explicitly call the gc every k allocations
