This benchmark comes from:  

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lorenz/papers/aosd2003lod/

The paper proposes a checker for Java programs that checks the Law
of Demeter.  They propose a class form checker and an object form
checker, and give the aspectJ code for each of them.

In the benchmark in this directory is their code for the object form
checker, with a small modification.   The modification just stores all
the errors in a hash table and prints them out at the exit of main.  The
original code printed out the same error each time it was encountered, leading
to potentially large output files.   

This is a pretty interesting benchmark because it uses relatively complex
join points,  percflow, pertarget, and cflow.    

The basic idea is that a program has correct LofD object form when an
object can only send messages to:
  1) itself
  2) its arguments
  3) its instance variables
  4) a locally-constructed object, or
  5) a returned object from a message sent to itself.

The code basically uses percflow to create a little hash table for
each calling context,  puts valid (or preferred in their language) objects
into that hash table, and then checks that method calls use a preferred
object, otherwise it is an error.

This means that each field set, and each method call gets instrumented
with some non-trival code to insert and lookup into hash tables.   Thus,
we would expect the instrumented code to run slower than the uninstrumented
code.  

However, when we apply the LoD aspects to our simulator program we find
the following, when running on a very small simulation, made as follows:

cp lawOfDemeter/Any_cflow.java lawOfDemeter/Any.java
ajc certrevsim/*.java jsim/*/*.java lawOfDemeter/Any.java lawOfDemeter/objectform/*.java
time java certrevsim.Simulator 10 30 90 5 6 1 1

The checker finds only three LoD object form violiations, as follows:
    
 !! LoD Object Violation !! call(double certrevsim.RevocationInfo.getNextUpdate()) at EndEntity.java:26
 !! LoD Object Violation !! call(double certrevsim.RevocationInfo.getFirstDeltaUpdate()) at EndEntity.java:29
 !! LoD Object Violation !! call(RevocationInfo certrevsim.Repository.requestRevocationInfo()) at Simulator.java:248

which means that the simulator code fairly well written in terms of LoD.

However, when we look at run times, we get 

Instrumented code:
  6.320u 0.030s 0:06.79 93.5%     0+0k 0+0io 1487pf+0w

Uninstrumented code: (created using ajc certrevsim/*.java jsim/*/*.java)
  0.200u 0.020s 0:00.24 91.6%     0+0k 0+0io 1464pf+0w

which is about a 30 fold slowdown for the instrumentation.   So, it would
be nice to look at the metrics and find out what is going on.

I decompiled the code 
(using soot -f dava --app certrevsim.Simulator) and found that ajc 
is doing very bad things with the implemenation of cflow .... even 
worse than you might imagine ...

If we look at the file lawOfDemeter/Any.java

package lawOfDemeter;
public abstract class Any {
  public pointcut scope(): !within(lawOfDemeter..*) 
    && 
    !cflow(withincode(* lawOfDemeter..*(..))) 
    ;
  public pointcut StaticInitialization(): scope()
    && staticinitialization(*);
  public pointcut MethodCallSite(): scope()
    && call(* *(..));
  public pointcut ConstructorCall(): scope()
    && call(*.new (..));
  public pointcut MethodExecution(): scope()
    && execution(* *(..)); 
  public pointcut ConstructorExecution(): scope()
    && execution(*.new (..));
....
}

it defines the scope() pointcut with a cflow, and then scope() is used
all over the place in other pointcuts.    It seems that ajc expands the
pointcuts so that many copies of the cflow() get copied,  and each copy
leads to its own cflow stack (which is of course stacking 0-length object
arrays).   

Here is a snippet from the decompiled code of the addAll method from
the ObjectSupplier aspect.  

Note that it is building 25 parallel cflow stacks ...  and these methods
are exactly the ones that get called at every method entry,  so the
overhead is amazing.

----------------------------------

abstract class ObjectSupplier implements lawOfDemeter.objectform.Pertarget$ajcMightHaveAspect
{
    private java.util.IdentityHashMap targets;
    private transient lawOfDemeter.objectform.Pertarget ajc$lawOfDemeter_objectform_Pertarget$perObjectField;

    protected void addAll(java.lang.Object[] r1) throws java.lang.Throwable
    {
        java.lang.Object[] r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15, r16, r17, r18, r19, r20, r21, r22, r23, r24, r25;
        int i0;
        java.lang.Throwable r26, r27, r28, r29, r30, r31, r32, r33, r34, r35, r36, r37, r38, r39, r40, r41, r42, r43, r44, r45, r46, r47, r48, r49;
        java.lang.Object $r63;

        r2 = new Object[0];
        Pertarget.ajc$cflowStack$1.push(r2);

        try
        {
            r3 = new Object[0];
            Pertarget.ajc$cflowStack$0.push(r3);

            try
            {
                r4 = new Object[0];
                Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$9.push(r4);

                try
                {
                    r5 = new Object[0];
                    Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$8.push(r5);

                    try
                    {
                        r6 = new Object[0];
                        Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$7.push(r6);

                        try
                        {
                            r7 = new Object[0];
                            Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$6.push(r7);

                            try
                            {
                                r8 = new Object[0];
                                Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$5.push(r8);

                                try
                                {
                                    r9 = new Object[0];
                                    Percflow.ajc$cflowStack$4.push(r9);
...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get an idea of the overhead involved,  I compiled another version of
the benchmark,  without the cflow clause in scope()
   (cp lawOfDemeter/Any_nocflow.java lawOfDemeter/Any.java, and then
      remake)

Note that for the case of the simulator, the lawOfDemeter code can't call
any of the simulator code,  so the cflow check is not really necessary.

Now the execution times are:

Instrumented code (with cflow):
  6.320u 0.030s 0:06.79 93.5%     0+0k 0+0io 1487pf+0w

Instrumented code (without cflow)
  0.390u 0.020s 0:00.48 85.4%     0+0k 0+0io 1487pf+0w

Uninstrumented code:
  0.200u 0.020s 0:00.24 91.6%     0+0k 0+0io 1464pf+0w

So, a huge amount of the overhead is coming from the bad implementation of
cflow.
