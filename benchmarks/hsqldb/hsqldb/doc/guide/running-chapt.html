<p>The HyperSQL RDBMS and JDBC Driver provide the core functionality.
    An additional jar contains Sql Tool (command line database access tool).
    SqlTool and the DatabaseManagers are general-purpose database tools that

<p>The tools are used for interactive user access to databases,
    including creation of a database, inserting or modifying data, or querying
    the database. All tools are run in the normal way for Java programs. In
    the following example the Swing version of the Database Manager is
    executed. The <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> is located in the directory
    <code class="filename">../lib</code> relative to the current directory.</p>
<pre class="screen">java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing</pre>
<p>If <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> is in the current directory, the
    command would change to:</p>
<pre class="screen">java -cp hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing</pre>

<a name="running_db-sect"></a>A HyperSQL Database</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each HyperSQL database is called a catalog. There are three types of
    catalog depending on how the data is stored.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<p class="title">
<b>Types of catalog data</b>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
<em class="glossterm">mem:</em> stored entirely in RAM - without any
        persistence beyond the JVM process's life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em class="glossterm">file:</em> stored in filesystem files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em class="glossterm">res:</em> stored in a Java resource, such as a
        Jar and always read-only</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All-in-memory, <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> catalogs can be used for
    test data or as sophisticated caches for an application. These databases
    do not have any files.</p>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">file</em>: catalog consists of between 2 to 5
    files, all named the same but with different extensions, located in the
    same directory. For example, the database named "test" consists of the
    following files:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.properties</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.script</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.log</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.data</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.backup</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code class="filename">test.lobs</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The properties file contains a few settings about the database. The
    script file contains the definition of tables and other database objects,
    plus the data for non-cached tables. The log file contains recent changes
    to the database. The data file contains the data for cached tables and the
    backup file is a compressed backup of the last known consistent state of
    the data file. All these files are essential and should never be deleted.
    For some catalogs, the <code class="filename">test.data</code> and
    <code class="filename">test.backup</code> files will not be present. In addition to
    those files, a HyperSQL database may link to any formatted text files,
    such as CSV lists, anywhere on the disk.</p>
<p>While the "test" catalog is open, a <code class="filename">test.log</code>
    file is used to write the changes made to data. This file is removed at a
    normal SHUTDOWN. Otherwise (with abnormal shutdown) this file is used at
    the next startup to redo the changes. A <code class="filename">test.lck </code>file
    is also used to record the fact that the database is open. This is deleted
    at a normal SHUTDOWN.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<table border="0" summary="Note">

<tr>
<td valign="top" align="left">
<p>When the engine closes the database at a shutdown, it creates
      temporary files with the extension <code class="literal">.new</code> which it then
      renames to those listed above. In some circumstances, a
      <code class="filename">test.data.old</code> is created and deleted afterwards.
      These files should not be deleted by the user. At the time of the next
      startup, all such files will be deleted by the database engine.</p>

<p>A <em class="glossterm">res:</em> catalog consists of the files for a
    small, read-only database that can be stored inside a Java resource such
    as a ZIP or JAR archive and distributed as part of a Java application
    program.</p>

<a name="running_inprocess-sect"></a>In-Process Access to Database Catalogs</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In general, JDBC is used for all access to databases. This is done
    by making a connection to the database, then using various methods of the
    <code class="classname">java.sql.Connection</code> object that is returned to
    access the data. Access to an <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database
    is started from JDBC, with the database path specified in the connection
    URL. For example, if the <em class="glossterm">file: </em>database name is
    "testdb" and its files are located in the same directory as where the
    command to run your application was issued, the following code is used for
    the connection:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">  Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:file:testdb", "SA", "");</pre>
<p>The database file path format can be specified using forward slashes
    in Windows hosts as well as Linux hosts. So relative paths or paths that
    refer to the same directory on the same drive can be identical. For
    example if your database path in Linux is
    <code class="filename">/opt/db/testdb</code> and you create an identical directory
    structure on the <code class="literal">C:</code> drive of a Windows host, you can
    use the same URL in both Windows and Linux:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">  Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/db/testdb", "SA", "");</pre>
<p>When using relative paths, these paths will be taken relative to the
    directory in which the shell command to start the Java Virtual Machine was
    executed. Refer to the Javadoc for <code class="classname"><a class="classname" href="apd.html#JDBCConnection.html-link">JDBCConnection</a></code> for more
    details.</p>
<p>Paths and database names for file databases are treated as
    case-sensitive when the database is created or the first connection is
    made to the database. But if a second connection is made to an open
    database, using a path and name that differs only in case, then the
    connection is made to the existing open database. This measure is
    necessary because in Windows the two paths are equivalent.</p>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> database is specified by the
    <em class="glossterm">mem:</em> protocol. For <em class="glossterm">mem:</em>
    databases, the path is simply a name. Several <em class="glossterm">mem:</em>
    databases can exist at the same time and distinguished by their names. In
    the example below, the database is called "mymemdb":</p>
<pre class="programlisting">  Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:mem:mymemdb", "SA", "");</pre>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">res:</em> database, is specified by the
    <em class="glossterm">res:</em> protocol. As it is a Java resource, the
    database path is a Java URL (similar to the path to a class). In the
    example below, "resdb" is the root name of the database files, which
    exists in the directory "org/my/path" within the classpath (probably in a
    Jar). A Java resource is stored in a compressed format and is decompressed
    in memory when it is used. For this reason, a <em class="glossterm">res:</em>
    database should not contain large amounts of data and is always
    read-only.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">  Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:res:org.my.path.resdb", "SA", "");</pre>
<p>The first time <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connection is made
    to a database, some general data structures are initialised and a few
    helper threads are started. After this, creation of connections and calls
    to JDBC methods of the connections execute as if they are part of the Java
    application that is making the calls. When the SQL command "SHUTDOWN" is
    executed, the global structures and helper threads for the database are
    destroyed.</p>
<p>Note that only one Java process at a time can make
    <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections to a given
    <em class="glossterm">file:</em> database. However, if the
    <em class="glossterm">file:</em> database has been made read-only, or if
    connections are made to a <em class="glossterm">res:</em> database, then it is
    possible to make <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections from
    multiple Java processes.</p>

<a name="running_modes-sect"></a>Listener / Server Modes</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For most applications, <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> access is
    faster, as the data is not converted and sent over the network. The main
    drawback is that it is not possible by default to connect to the database
    from outside your application. As a result you cannot check the contents
    of the database with external tools such as Database Manager while your
    application is running.</p>
<p>Server modes provide the maximum accessibility. The database engine
    runs in a JVM and opens one or more <em class="glossterm">in-process</em>
    catalogs. It listens for connections from programs on the same computer or
    other computers on the network. It translates these connections into
    <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections to the databases.</p>
<p>Several different programs can connect to the server and retrieve or
    update information. Applications programs (clients) connect to the server
    using the HyperSQL JDBC driver. In most server modes, the server can serve
    an unlimited number of databases that are specified at the time of running
    the server, or optionally, as a connection request is received.</p>
<p>A Sever mode is also the prefered mode of running the database
    during development. It allows you to query the database from a separate
    database access utility while your application is running.</p>
<p>There are three server modes, based on the protocol used for
    communications between the client and server. They are briefly discussed
    below. More details on servers is provided in the <a class="link" href="listeners-chapt.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;13.&nbsp;HyperSQL Network Listeners">HyperSQL Network Listeners</a> chapter.</p>

<a name="running_hsqlserver-sect"></a>HyperSQL HSQL Server</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the preferred way of running a database server and the
      fastest one. A proprietary communications protocol is used for this
      mode. A command similar to those used for running tools and described
      above is used for running the server. The following example of the
      command for starting the server starts the server with one (default)
      database with files named "mydb.*" and the public name of "xdb". The
      public name hides the file names from users.</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="screen">  java -cp ../lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server --database.0 file:mydb --dbname.0 xdb</pre>
</div>
<p>The command line argument <code class="literal">--help</code> can be used to

<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="running_httpserver-sect"></a>HyperSQL HTTP Server</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This method of access is used when the computer hosting the
      database server is restricted to the HTTP protocol. The only reason for
      using this method of access is restrictions imposed by firewalls on the
      client or server machines and it should not be used where there are no
      such restrictions. The HyperSQL HTTP Server is a special web server that
      allows JDBC clients to connect via HTTP. The server can also act as a
      small general-purpose web server for static pages.</p>
<p>To run an HTTP server, replace the main class for the server in
      the example command line above with the following:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="screen">  org.hsqldb.server.WebServer</pre>

<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="running_servlet-sect"></a>HyperSQL HTTP Servlet</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This method of access also uses the HTTP protocol. It is used when
      a separate servlet engine (or application server) such as Tomcat or
      Resin provides access to the database. The Servlet Mode cannot be
      started independently from the servlet engine. The
      <code class="filename">Servlet</code> class, in the HSQLDB jar, should be
      installed on the application server to provide the connection. The
      database is specified using an application server property. Refer to the
      source file <code class="filename"><a class="filename" href="apd.html#Servlet.java-link">
      src/org/hsqldb/server/Servlet.java</a></code> to see the details.</p>
<p>Both HTTP Server and Servlet modes can only be accessed using the
      JDBC driver at the client end. They do not provide a web front end to
      the database. The Servlet mode can serve only a single database.</p>
<p>Please note that you do not normally use this mode if you are
      using the database engine in an application server. In this situation,
      connections to a catalog are usually made
      <em class="glossterm">in-process</em>, or using a separate Server</p>

<a name="running_connecting-sect"></a>Connecting to a Database Server</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When a HyperSQL server is running, client programs can connect to
      it using the HSQLDB JDBC Driver contained in
      <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code>. Full information on how to connect to a
      server is provided in the Java Documentation for <code class="classname"><a class="classname" href="apd.html#JDBCConnection.html-link"> JDBCConnection</a></code>
      (located in the <code class="filename">/doc/apidocs</code> directory of HSQLDB
      distribution). A common example is connection to the default port (9001)
      used for the <em class="glossterm">hsql:</em> protocol on the same
      machine:</p>
<div class="example">
<a name="N1021A"></a>
<p class="title">
<b>Example&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;Java code to connect to the local hsql Server</b>

      e.printStackTrace();
      return;
  }

  Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/xdb", "SA", "");</pre>
</div>
</div>
<br class="example-break">
<p>If the HyperSQL HTTP server is used, the protocol is
      <em class="glossterm">http:</em> and the URL will be different:</p>

<p>Note in the above connection URL, there is no mention of the
      database file, as this was specified when running the server. Instead,

<a name="running_security-sect"></a>Security Considerations</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<a name="N10233" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>When a HyperSQL server is run, network access should be adequately
      protected. Source IP addresses may be restricted by use of our <a class="link" href="listeners-chapt.html#listeners_acl-sect" title="Network Access Control">Access Control List feature</a>,
      network filtering software, firewall software, or standalone firewalls.
      Only secure passwords should be used-- most importantly, the password
      for the default system user should be changed from the default empty
      string. If you are purposefully providing data to the public, then the
      wide-open public network connection should be used exclusively to access
      the public data via read-only accounts. (i.e., neither secure data nor
      privileged accounts should use this connection). These considerations
      also apply to HyperSQL servers run with the HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>HyperSQL provides two optional security mechanisms. The <a class="link" href="listeners-chapt.html#listeners_tls-sect" title="TLS Encryption">encrypted SSL protocol</a>, and
      <a class="link" href="listeners-chapt.html#listeners_acl-sect" title="Network Access Control">Access Control Lists</a>. Both
      mechanisms can be specified when running the Server or WebServer. From
      the client, the URL's co connect to an SSL server is slightly
      different:</p>

<p>A server can provide connections to more than one database. In the
      examples above, more than one set of database names can be specified on
      the command line. It is also possible to specify all the databases in a
      <code class="literal">.properties</code> file, instead of the command line. These
      capabilities are covered in the <a class="link" href="listeners-chapt.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;13.&nbsp;HyperSQL Network Listeners">HyperSQL Network Listeners</a> chapter</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As shown so far, a <code class="classname">java.sql.Connection</code> object
    is always used to access the database. But the speed and performance
    depends on the type of connection.</p>
<p>Establishing a connection and closing it has some overheads,
    therefore it is not good practice to create a new connection to perform a
    small number of operations. A connection should be reused as much as
    possible and closed only when it is not going to be used again for a long
    while.</p>
<p>Reuse is more important for server connections. A server connection
    uses a TCP port for communications. Each time a connection is made, a port
    is allocated by the operating system and deallocated after the connection
    is closed. If many connections are made from a single client, the
    operating system may not be able to keep up and may refuse the connection
    attempt.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.Connection</code> object has some methods
    that return further <code class="classname">java.sql.*</code> objects. All these
    objects belong to the connection that returned them and are closed when
    the connection is closed. These objects can be reused, but if they are not
    needed after performing the operations, they should be closed.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.DatabaseMetaData</code> object is used to
    get metadata for the database.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.Statement</code> object is used to
    execute queries and data change statements. A
    <code class="classname">java.sql.Statement</code> can be reused to execute a
    different statement each time.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> object is used
    to execute a single statement repeatedly. The SQL statement usually
    contains parameters, which can be set to new values before each reuse.
    When a <code class="classname">java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> object is
    created, the engine keeps the compiled SQL statement for reuse, until the
    <code class="classname">java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> object is closed. As a
    result, repeated use of a
    <code class="classname">java.sql.PreparedStatement</code> is much faster than
    using a <code class="classname">java.sql.Statement</code> object.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.CallableStatement</code> object is used
    to execute an SQL CALL statement. The SQL CALL statement may contain
    parameters, which should be set to new values before each reuse. Similar
    to <code class="classname">java.sql.PreparedStatement</code>, the engine keeps the
    compiled SQL statement for reuse, until the
    <code class="classname">java.sql.CallableStatement</code> object is closed.</p>
<p>A <code class="classname">java.sql.Connection</code> object also has some
    methods for transaction control.</p>
<p>The <code class="methodname">commit()</code> method performs a
    <code class="literal">COMMIT</code> while the <code class="methodname">rollback()</code>
    method performs a <code class="literal">ROLLBACK</code> SQL statement.</p>
<p>The <code class="methodname">setSavepoint(String name)</code> method
    performs a <code class="literal">SAVEPOINT &lt;name&gt;</code> SQL statement and
    returns a <code class="classname">java.sql.Savepoint</code> object. The
    <code class="methodname">rollback(Savepoint name)</code> method performs a
    <code class="literal">ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT &lt;name&gt;</code> SQL
    statement.</p>

<a name="running_closing-sect"></a>Closing the Database</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>All databases running in different modes can be closed with the
    SHUTDOWN command, issued as an SQL statement.</p>
<p>When SHUTDOWN is issued, all active transactions are rolled back.
    The catalog files are then saved in a form that can be opened quickly the
    next time the catalog is opened.</p>
<p>A special form of closing the database is via the SHUTDOWN COMPACT
    command. This command rewrites the <code class="literal">.data</code> file that
    contains the information stored in CACHED tables and compacts it to its
    minimum size. This command should be issued periodically, especially when
    lots of inserts, updates or deletes have been performed on the cached
    tables. Changes to the structure of the database, such as dropping or
    modifying populated CACHED tables or indexes also create large amounts of
    unused file space that can be reclaimed using this command.</p>
<p>Databases are not closed when the last connection to the database is
    explicitly closed via JDBC. A connection property,
    <code class="literal">shutdown=true</code>, can be specified on the first connection
    to the database (the connection that opens the database) to force a
    shutdown when the last connection closes.</p>

<a name="running_newdb-sect"></a>Creating a New Database</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When a server instance is started, or when a connection is made to
    an <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database, a new, empty database is
    created if no database exists at the given path.</p>
<p>With HyperSQL 2.0 the username and password that are specified for
    the connection are used for the new database. Both the username and
    password are case-sensitive. (The exception is the default SA user, which
    is not case-sensitive). If no username or password is specified, the
    default SA user and an empty password are used.</p>
<p>This feature has a side effect that can confuse new users. If a
    mistake is made in specifying the path for connecting to an existing
    database, a connection is nevertheless established to a new database. For
    troubleshooting purposes, you can specify a connection property
    <span class="property">ifexists</span>=<code class="literal">true</code> to allow connection
    to an existing database only and avoid creating a new database. In this
    case, if the database does not exist, the
    <code class="methodname">getConnection()</code> method will throw an
    exception.</p>
