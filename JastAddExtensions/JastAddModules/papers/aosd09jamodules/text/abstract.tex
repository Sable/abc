Inter-type declarations (ITDs) in current aspect-oriented languages have
limited extensibility: it is difficult to change the behavior of
existing ITDs when extending a system written in an aspect-oriented
language. We introduce a module system that allows for ITD extensibility, and
demonstrate that modules also provide the additional benefits of 
information hiding and explicit dependency specification. The
module system is also used on a moderately-sized case study on
a Java compiler written in JastAdd, an aspect-oriented compiler
construction framework.
