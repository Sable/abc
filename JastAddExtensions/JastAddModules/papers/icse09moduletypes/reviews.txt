Dear Neil,

Thank you for your submission to ICSE 2009. The program committee met
on November 14-15 to consider the submissions to the Research Paper 
track.  We regret to inform you that we could not accept your paper,

  "Modules as Object-Oriented Types"

for inclusion in the conference program.  The competition was strong: 
only 50 of the 405 submissions were accepted, giving an acceptance 
rate of 12.3%.  The overall quality of the submissions this year was 
very high, and the Program Committee had a difficult time selecting 
from among the many high caliber papers.

You might consider revising your paper and submitting it to either 
the New Ideas and Emerging Results track (if the reviewers are positive
about your work but comment on weak evaluation) or the Research Demos
track (if your paper presents a tool). Both of these tracks have 
deadlines of December 5, 2008.  Information about their calls for 
papers can be found on the conference web page.

We enclose the reviews of your paper, and hope that you find them
useful for revising your paper.

Thank you again for your submission, and we hope that you will plan 
to attend the conference, which will be held May 16-24 in Vancouver, 
Canada.


Sincerely,

Joanne M. Atlee and Paola Inverardi
Program Committee Co-Chairs
ICSE 2009

First reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

This paper proposes to handle collections of Java classes as modules typed in
an object-oriented way. It then informally defines relations and operations on
these types, such as subtyping, overriding, or merging. These relations and
operations are shown to model common module operations and constraints now in
use while adding new capabilities, such as backward compatibility constraints,
fine-grained module sharing specifications and module extension. The type
system itself is implemented in a module-enabled compiler for Java using
JastAdd, an aspect-oriented compiler framework, and is demonstrated on a small
case study on JHotdraw.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

It is clear that the SE community in is deep need of a properly defined and
practically usable modularity concept defined at coarser grain than the notion
of class. The usual notion of package (as in Java), a simple container of
classes with little added semantics, is way too light for that (that's the
problem leading to the JAR hell).

So this paper makes an interesting step into that direction, by proposing a
type system on collection of classes, and showing how it can be helpful to
solve a number of issues in deploying and evolving collections of Java
classes. Furthermore, as a very strong point, there appears to be an
implementation of the ideas presented in the paper.

However the type system is proposed at an informal level only, concentrating
on the user's point of view and on the Java syntax extensions. This makes it
difficult to get an high level picture of the semantics of the typing
system. Furthermore, knowing the great difficulty in correctly dealing with
substitutability with group of classes (see the works related to Scala, or
even
to substitutability of parameterized Java5 classes), this does not inspire
confidence in the soundness of a type system presented at that level of
abstraction (the devil as always is in the details).

It could also be interesting to discuss this work in relation with the notion
of package merge in MOF and UML, and also the notion of "model type" and model
type matching and substitutability. There are indeed other examples of module
systems for handling collections of classes at a more abstract level that
containers with meta-data.

Second reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

Describes a module system for Java in which modules are treated like classes in
an inheritance hierarchy, and have a number of composition operators, such as
override, merge and replace. Discusses how this approach can realize the
benefits provided by some existing Java module systems such as OSGi, and some
additional ones also. Briefly describes an implementation done with package
name mangling (rather than modified runtime class loading).

          >>> Evaluation <<<

+ An interesting approach to modules in Java (though the idea of modules as
types in itself is not new)
+ Appealing integration of a number of good features of Java module systems
+ Good case study and discussion

- A lot of features and rules are described, each with some explanation and
justification, and each seems reasonable. But I was left without a clear
picture to completeness or correctness. How do I know that this set of features
is what is really needed, and that they work well together? Are there Java
modularization problems that the approach does not solve? Most type system
papers have a formal part to prove that the type system really does work; I
hesitate to insist on that, but something is needed by way of validation.

- The problem of split packages is never really explained. There is a reference
to details, but this issue is mentioned often enough later in the paper that
section 2.1 should contain a brief explanation f what the problem really is
(i.e., why do packages that are split across modules cause trouble?).

- The related work sections does a good job of giving credit for various ideas
that went into or influenced the proposal presented in the paper, but it does
not describe them or why they are not good enough (except for OSGi and to some
extent iJAM). It also does not discuss any other systems, such as AHEAD (or the
precursor, mixin-layers (Batory)) or other work in the aspect-oriented field
(which has a different emphasis, but touches many of the same points in pursuit
of extensibility).

- The prototype implementation is a fine starting point, but an implementation
involving runtime classloaders is needed to give confidence that this approach
is viable for real Java systems.

- If modules are OO types, I would expect their to be some relationship between
them and the other types (classes and interfaces) in the OO software. For
example, do they become first-class entities, enabling reflection? This issue
is not even mentioned (I understand that solving it is probably another whole
research project).

Third reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

The paper presents a flexible module system for Java, with advanced features
such as renaming, import/export, subtyping, and overriding. These features
are presented and explained using a single running example (JHotdraw). The work
has been implemented using the extensible JastAdd compiler framework.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

The presentation of this paper is overly informal and immature. I applaud the
author for conducting such a detailed case study, but I think that a more
formal exposition of the semantics of the module system is required. My
recommendation to the author is to revise this paper in a way where the
language is presented formally first (including the statement of properties of
the module system), followed by a discussion of the JHotdraw case study. 

As a general comment, I think it is good that the language features are
explained using concrete examples. But in many cases, the example is not
explained well enough, and the author should try to explain *why* the feature
is needed in each example. 

Detailed suggestions:

 - page 1: is JAR hell a term that has been used before? If so, please support
it with a citation

 - page 1: "split packages" need to be explained more precisely.

 - "non-formally" ==> "informally"

 - page 2: a somewhat more detailed review of OSGi bundles and JSR 277 would be
helpful

 - page 2: "java" ==> "Java"

 - section 2.4 feels too vague. in particular, the terms "parent-then-self" and
"self-then-parent" need more explanation

 - page 3: at this point, it still isn't completely clear what is meant by the
split packages problem. A concrete example would be helpful

 - page 3: why would cycles involving singleton modules be useful?

 - page 4: please explain why indirection is needed

 - listing 1: what is meant by on-demand importing?

 - I don't understand the last paragraph of section 3.5. It seems to me that
one could override class Action and only override the method that needs to be
changed, just like you do in listing 3. I must be missing the point here

 - page 6: "change over" ==> "update"

 - listing 4: please explain and motivate the use of singleton here

 - the feature in section 3.10 sounds a lot like structural typing. Please
explain the correspondence

 - related work seems a bit short
