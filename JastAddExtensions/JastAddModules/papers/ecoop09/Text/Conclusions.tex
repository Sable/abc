Existing module systems for Java-like languages have been developed
to handle JAR hell, but are unable to handle split packages,
express backward compatibility constraints and module extension.

The module type system presented in this paper is able to express the common operations
in current use on Java modules, and allows the handling of split packages through
module qualifiers, backward compatibility through overrides and module interfaces,
and module extension through subtyping. We have
also provided an implementation to demonstrate that it is
possible to realize this type system in an actual Java compiler,
and have demonstrated it on a small case study in JHotdraw.

We believe that the system provides a good conceptual
model for thinking about modules in Java and similar languages,
and that the new features allowed by the type system are worthy
of addition to any module system for Java-like languages.
