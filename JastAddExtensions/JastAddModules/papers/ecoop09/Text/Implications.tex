Treating modules as types provide a more elegant solution to JAR hell, as the module
type errors occur at compile time, and load time errors will occur at the module level
instead of the class level. This would make it a lot easier to diagnose and
fix problems caused by wrong class lookups.

Note that the syntax only represents the type system, it is not the only way
to implement it. As mentioned, overriding is already implicitly implemented
by versions. Other existing features such as loose coupling in OSGi can
also be modeled, i.e. by using weak interfaces and a generated import and replace
declaration. The type system is also not limited to
the current implementation. For example, the import declaration can be 
extended to use OSGi's extensive constraint features for packages and bundles.

Separate compilation of modules with module interface dependencies would require
the ability to compile and lookup module qualified names during runtime. We believe
it is possible to do so with a classloader implementation of the module system. Reflection
APIs would also require the context in which the lookup should be done in addition to
the class' package and name. These are left as future work.

The overrides declaration creates synthetic types for the overriden modules 
if they are not present in the compilation. These types are currently very loose,
in that they can be assigned to a module reference of any type. Tightening the
constraints on synthetic types using information from overriding types is left
as future work.

Merge and replace are currently just used in the module's ``constructor'', that is, in
the module's instantiation instructions. These may be extended to be executed in the context
of a running repository, and may provide the basis for a language for module upgrades and replacement.
