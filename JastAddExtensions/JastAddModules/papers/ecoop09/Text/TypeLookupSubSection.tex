\subsection{Type Lookup Sequence}

This module system, as with any module system for Java, changes the way that type
references are looked up. The following pseudocode shows how type lookup is done in
the type system defined above. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Type Lookup, tabsize=2, morekeywords={method}]
//lookup for unqualified names in a CU
method CU.lookup(typeName) {
	//get the module of which the CU is a member
	Module = CU.getParentModule();
	if (Module != null) {
		lookup classes in CU
		lookup classes in single type imports
		//lookup in module and its supermodules only
		Module.lookup(null, CU.package(), typeName, false)
		lookup classes in on-demand imports
		//lookup in module, including direct imports
		Module.lookup(null, CU.package(), typeName, true)
		lookup primitive types
		lookup automatic imports (java.lang)
	} else {
		normal java lookup
	}
}

//Lookup for qualified names. Takes the module qualifier, package
//qualifier and typeName of a type reference and a boolean value lookInImports
method Module.lookup(moduleName, packageName, 
							typeName, lookInImports) {
	if (special packageName (java.lang)) {
		lookup in defaultmodule
	}
	if (moduleName == null) {
		lookup in thismodule
		lookup in each successive supermodule
		if (lookInImports) {
			lookup in direct imports
		}
	} 
	else {
	//lookup through the module qualifier
	contextModule = lookupModule(moduleName);
	contextModule.lookup(``'', packageName, typeName, false);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The lookup rules follow the Java way of looking up types,
starting from the most local proceeding to the most global. Types are looked up
first in the same compilation unit, then in the single type imports,
then in the types that belong to the same package in the module and its supermodules, 
then the on-demand imports, then the member types of the same package
in directly imported modules, and finally to the primitive types and the 
implicit {\tt java.lang} imports. It was a conscious decision to make on-demand imports
come first before the lookups to directly imported modules. This is because the on-demand import
is closer to the type reference being resolved, being in the same source file instead of
on a separate module specification file.
